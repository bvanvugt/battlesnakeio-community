Our Mission
===========

Battlesnake will make programming fun and accessible for millions of people.

Our Values
==========

These values drive us towards our mission. Everything we do and every decision we make should relate directly to one or more of these values.

**Battlesnake teaches real-world programming skills.** When it comes to programming technologies, we work hard to teach participants to use "the real thing". This includes programming languages, editors, version control, platforms, libraries, etc.

**Battlesnake celebrates a broad range of skill levels.** Writing a snake that performs very well should be a celebrated accomplishment. Writing your first snake, no matter how simple, should be equally celebrated.

**Battlesnake encourages collaboration over competition.** Even though Battlesnake involves a competitive game, participants, sponsors, and volunteers are working together to help each other be successful. We believe making all teams stronger makes Battlesnake better.

**Battlesnake embraces open-source software.** We firmly believe in the power of open-source collaboration. All Battlesnake development is public and transparent, and we encourage participants to do the same.

**Battlesnake builds community.** We work hard to encourage and grow a large and diverse community. Anyone who wants to participate or volunteer should feel welcome and supported. Anyone with ideas should feel heard and appreciated.

**Battlesnake is a spectator sport.** Watching games should be exciting for everyone. Even if you don't know how to program, or don't care to learn, Battlesnake events should be fun and exhilarating.
